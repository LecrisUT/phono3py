External tools
===============

Here external tools related to phono3py but supported by the groups out
of the phono3py project are listed.

Each of the tools is not supported by the phono3py project because of
the difficulties of the maintenance and the test by main developers
of phono3py under current style of phono3py development. However
useful tools should be known. If developers want to use here to notify
their tools, please contact via the phonopy mailing list.

Phono3py-Power-Tools
---------------------

https://github.com/skelton-group/Phono3py-Power-Tools

For example, nice plots can be easily made using phono3py-mode-plot.


Kinetic Collective Model
-------------------------

The Kinetic Collective Model (KCM), developed by the nanoTransport
group of the Universitat Aut√≤noma de Barcelona, is a generalization of
the Guyer and Krumhansl solution of the phonon Boltzmann Transport
Equation. KCM allows to compute the thermal conductivity of
semiconductors in a fast and low memory way from first principles
calculations.
